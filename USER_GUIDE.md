## Trade Analyzer

Evaluate trades with customizable percentage values for each card.

### How It Works

The Trade Analyzer helps you determine if a trade is fair by comparing the total value of cards you're giving vs. cards you're receiving.

You can set custom percentages for each card (e.g., value a Charizard at 80% market price because it's harder to sell).

### Creating a Trade Analysis

1. Go to **Tools** → **Trade Analyzer**
2. Tap **+ New Trade**
3. **Add Cards You're Giving**:
   - Tap **+ Add Card**
   - Search for card
   - Set **Percentage** (default: 80%)
     - 80% = value at 80% of market price
     - 100% = value at full market price
     - 50% = value at half market price
   - Repeat for all cards you're giving
4. **Add Cards You're Receiving**:
   - Same process as above
   - Set percentage for each received card
5. Tap **Calculate**

### Reading the Results

You'll see:

**Your Side**:
- Cards you're giving
- Market value per card
- Adjusted value (market × percentage)
- **Total Value**: Sum of all adjusted values

**Their Side**:
- Cards you're receiving
- Market value per card
- Adjusted value (market × percentage)
- **Total Value**: Sum of all adjusted values

**Trade Result**:
- **Green** = Good trade (you're getting more value)
- **Red** = Bad trade (you're giving more value)
- **Yellow** = Fair trade (values are close)

**Difference**: How much you're winning/losing in the trade

### Setting Custom Percentages

Why would you value a card below 100%?

- **Slow movers**: Cards that sit in inventory (value at 70-80%)
- **Condition**: Damaged cards (value at 40-60%)
- **Demand**: Cards you know sell quickly (value at 90-100%)
- **Personal preference**: Cards you want (value at 100%+)

**Example**:
- Charizard VMAX (market: $100) at 80% = $80 trade value
- You're less confident you'll sell it quickly, so you value it conservatively

### Saving Trade Analyses

1. After calculating, tap **Save Trade**
2. Add a name (e.g., "Trade with John at Card Show")
3. View saved trades in **Trade History**

This helps you track what trades you've analyzed and reference them later.

## Tips & Tricks

### Speed Tips

**Quick Add to Inventory**:
After looking up a card price, tap **Add to Inventory** to save it in one tap.

**Swipe Actions**:
In your inventory list:
- Swipe left on a card → **Delete**
- Swipe right on a card → **Mark as Sold**

**Keyboard Shortcuts** (iPad only):
- `Cmd + F`: Focus search bar
- `Cmd + N`: Add new card
- `Cmd + ,`: Open settings

### Organization Tips

**Use Tags** (coming soon):
Tag cards by:
- Storage location ("Binder 1", "Display Case")
- Sale priority ("Hot Items", "Clearance")
- Source ("Card Show Jan 2026")

**Create Sets**:
Group related cards together for easier management.

**Set Profit Goals**:
Mark cards you want to hit a certain profit margin on before selling.

### Pricing Strategy Tips

**Buy Low, Sell High**:
CardShow Pro shows profit margins in real-time. Look for cards where:
- Profit Margin > 50% = Great flip
- Profit Margin 25-50% = Good flip
- Profit Margin < 25% = Consider holding

**Monitor Price Trends** (Pro feature):
Enable price alerts to get notified when a card's value increases by 10%+ overnight.

**Time Your Sales**:
Analytics show which days/times you get the most sales. Use this to list high-value cards strategically.

### Vendor Mode Tips

**Pre-Load Inventory**:
Before a show, add all cards you're bringing to your inventory with purchase costs. This makes quick sales instant.

**Use Quick Sale**:
During busy times, use Quick Sale to record transactions in seconds.

**Collect Emails**:
Add customers to your CRM during the event, then email them after with new arrivals.

### Trade Tips

**Be Conservative**:
Set trade percentages at 80% for cards you're unsure about. Better to under-value than over-value.

**Factor in Demand**:
A $100 card that sells in 1 day is worth more than a $100 card that sits for 6 months.

**Use Trade History**:
Save all your trade analyses. Review them later to see which trades were good/bad.
